<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> Hi all! My name is Kai Brown and I am a video editor, currently looking for remote freelance work. I am a recent graduate from Eastlake High School and I will be attending Colorado School of Mines and playing football while maintaining a major in Quantitative Biosciences and Engineering. I hope that my portfolio provides you with a good look into my editing and myself.  </p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<h3>Sports News Editor at Eastlake High School</h3>
<h4>Aired weekly from September 2023 to June 2024</h4>
<p>After being a part of my school's sports show last year, as a newsperson, I expanded on my role by taking the role of full-time editor of the show. This required that I be highly skilled in Premiere Pro as with the many different episodes aired I would have to navigate through different cameras, filming styles, locations, and volumes to create a cohesive piece that also effectively entertained our audience (Eastlake High School and varying schools throughout Washington). </p>

<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>Though a link to all of my broadcasts will also be present, to save some time here are some highlights from different segments of the show that I find the best quality.</p>
<h3>Sports Highlights/Interviews *(Fan Favorite Segment)</h3>
<h3>Bench Scene/Sport Updates</h3>

<h2>What I'm currently looking for</h2>
<p>I am looking for a potential part-time employer that is willing to take me on as a remote video editor. I would be willing to negotiate pay depending on work but I'd like to say I wouldn't do under $18/hr and am fully open to any sort of calendar. I am willing to do any type of video, even if the exact format or type isn't shown in my discography. </p>
