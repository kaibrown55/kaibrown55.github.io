       <h1> Re: Eileen Dover University application </h1>

        <i>Dear Eileen</i><br>
Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science facility to study as part of your PAD, next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.

       <h2> Starting Dates</h2>
We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time. However, it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester: the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
<li>First semesters: <time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 16</time></li>
<li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-02-15">15 February 2017</time></li>
<li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
</ul>
Please let me know if this is ok and if so which start date you would prefer.
You can find more information about <p>important university<q cite="http://example.com"</q></p> dates on our website

      <h2> Subjects of study </h2>

At the Awesome Science Faculty. we have a pretty open-minded research facility -as long as the subjects tall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent. dedicated researcher and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saving that of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
<ol>
<li>1. Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
<li>2. Measuring the effect on the performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
<li>3. I and CSS constructs for representing musical scores</li>
</ol>   
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required start and other resources. and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    <h2> Exotic Dance Moves </h2>
Yes, you are night! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
<dl>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A Little-known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300RC. a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens. to encourage their livestock or be "truthful"</dd>
<dt>Icelandic browman shuttle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm. they used to practice this dance. which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuttling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerk</dd>ing
<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic. started movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on, however, it was discovered that they were ist moving like this because they were really cold</dd>
